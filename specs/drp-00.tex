\subsection{DRP-00: Small Scale Data Release Processing}
\label{drp-00}

\subsubsection{Objective}

This test specification demonstrates the successful execution of a Data
Release Production payload on a relatively small scale based on data from
precursor surveys.

It will demonstrate that:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Science payload code can be made available on systems managed by the
  LSST Data Facility;}

  \item{The Data Release Production science payload can be executed under the
  control of the Data Release Production Execution service;}

  \item{All required science data products can be collected by the execution
  service and made available for subsequent analysis;}

  \item{The Data Release Production payload generates results broadly
  equivalent to ``native'' reductions of precursor survey data.}

\end{itemize}

Note that this test specification does not extend to demonstrating the
detailed compliance of LSST data products with all \citeds[Science
Requirements Document]{LPM-17} level requirements: such a demonstration would
require carefully curated LSST-like datasets (or simulated data), a detailed
understanding of the LSST system, LSST-like calibration products, etc, which
are assumed not to be available for this test.

\subsubsection{Approach refinements}

The general approach defined in \citeds{LDM-503} is used.
